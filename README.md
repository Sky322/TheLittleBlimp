The Little Blimp
=======================

The little blimp is a sidecrolling flying shooter where you play as a little blimp. You are trying to fly your blimp home when a massive alien invasion comes out of nowhere and you must help defend the Earth from these UFO's.

To win you must make it to the home goal
To lose you just have to get shot down
