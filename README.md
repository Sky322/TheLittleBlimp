##Final Project Proposal

#The Little Blimp

*italics represent optional pieces that will be implemented if time allows*

The little blimp is a sidecrolling flying shooter where you play as a little blimp. You are trying to fly your blimp home when a massive alien invasion comes out of nowhere and you must help defend the Earth from these UFO's.

To win you must make it to the end and defeat the alien mothership
To lose you just have to get shot down

The player will use WASD or the arrow keys to move the ship across the screen. You will shoot with the left mouse button and have a special move with the right.

###Alien Enemys

------------------------

	* UFOs that hover and shoot projectiles straight across the sceen
	* small fast UFOs that dive bomb the player
	- *Ground unit that shots destroyable projectiles towards player*
	* MotherShip large ship with *destroyable projectiles that track* and small projectiles that shot diagonal and straight 
	
###PowerUPs

------------------------

	- FireUP: makes player shoot projectiles at 2X speed
	- BulkUP: makes player shot 2X as wide
	- Health: Gives back one health point to player
	- *GunUP: makes player shoot 3 projectiles, one straight one at 45 degrees up and down from there*
	
	powerups last 20 seconds
	
###HUD

------------------------

	- Health bar
	- Pause button
	- Active PowerUP
	- *progress bar*
	
ability to pause the game
obstacles such as buldings or windmills that the player can crash into
multiple levels or checkpoints depending on time constraints and what is easier to figure out in haxeFlixel.

add 3-4 different enemies and powerups 
I will make some basic graphics using adobe illustrator
get 3-4 checkpoints or levels done possibly more if I have extra time.
