# The Little Blimp

The little blimp is a sidecrolling flying shooter where you play as a little blimp. You are trying to fly your blimp home when a massive alien invasion comes out of nowhere and you must help defend the Earth from these UFO's.

To win you must make it to the end and defeat the alien mothership
To lose you just have to get shot down

The player will use WASD or the arrow keys to move the ship across the screen. You will shoot with the left mouse button and have a special move with the right.

Have a few different types of alien enemys
have some powerups to temporarily make the blimp stronger
ability to pause the game
obstacles such as buldings or windmills that the player can crash into
multiple levels or checkpoints depending on time constraints and what is easier to figure out in haxeFlixel.

I hope to add 3-4 different enemies and powerups 
I will make some basic graphics using adobe illustrator
get 3-4 checkpoints or levels done possibly more if I have extra time.
